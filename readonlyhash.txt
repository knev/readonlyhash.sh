# - deal with moved files? git?
# - deal with orphaned hash files? git?
# - what about entirely missing directories? git?

# File Changes:

File Permissions Changed: The permissions (read, write, execute) of a file are modified.
File Ownership Changed: The owner or group of a file is changed.
File Attributes Changed: Other metadata like timestamps (creation, last access) or file attributes (hidden, system) are modified.

# Directory Structure Changes:

Subdirectory Added: A new subdirectory is created within the directory.
Subdirectory Removed: An existing subdirectory is deleted.
Subdirectory Moved: A subdirectory is moved either within the directory or outside of it.
Subdirectory Renamed: The name of a subdirectory is changed.
Directory Permissions Changed: The permissions of the directory itself are modified.
Directory Ownership Changed: The owner or group of the directory is changed.

# Miscellaneous Changes:

Missing Directory: The entire directory might be removed or become inaccessible due to permissions or other system issues.
Corrupted Files: Files within the directory could become corrupted, although this might not directly change the directory listing but would affect file integrity.
Symlinks: Creation, deletion, or modification of symbolic links within the directory.
Hard Links: Changes in hard links could affect how files appear within the directory, although this is less common and more OS-specific.

# System-Related Changes:

Mount Points: If the directory is a mount point, changes in the mounted filesystem (like unmounting or remounting) would affect the directory's content or availability.
Network Drives: For directories on network drives, network issues or server-side changes can lead to perceived changes in the directory.
